                  Financial Year 2023 was yet another tough year for our
                  company as our numbers slipped from where we were last
                  year. This was further exacerbated by stock losses caused by
                  a sharp fall in the raw material prices. While a track record
                  of consistent profitability growth eludes us, I am confident
                  that our business continues to become more robust with
                  each passing year and has become more so over the last 12
                  fiscal months. Eventually, we will see the efforts of the last
                  8 years culminate into a business that will deliver stable and
                  relatively predictable results, less impacted by the vagaries
                  of the market and more as a result of competing from a
                  position of an unfair competitive advantage in our favour.
                  While the results were not favourable, there are several
                  small wins that we ought to celebrate.<br><br>

                    The robustness of our floor covering business improved
                    further. We added more customers to our portfolio and were
                    able to bring down our customer concentration further.
                    We have more business coming from alternate segments.
                    We commercialised our innovative products with more
                    customers and now have a bigger piece of the pie coming
                    from these products. Despite a year where the overall
                    market is down, we continued to maintain momentum.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We successfully completed the first phase of our expansion
                    in technical yarns and are on track to producing and selling
                    2.5x the volumes that we were producing earlier. We also
                    managed to expand our sales network internationally which
                    will create a robust pipeline of new customers over the
                    coming years.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While we have struggled with production efficiencies,
                    we have learnt a great deal about commercialising new
                    products and are far more equipped to commercialise
                    future innovations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While the textile division continues to drag profitability, we
                    have improved the share of value-added products such as
                    Mono yarns and Silque.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Our share of exports continued to grow and inched closer
                    to the 50% mark with the share of value-added products
                    increasing higher than before.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We have also successfully made progress on the supply chain
                    side by creating a more robust mix of suppliers, particularly
                    in auxiliaries such as packing materials and masterbatches,
                    reducing single vendor dependency in the several items.

                  That said, our business was plagued by several issues
                  which affected the profitability this year. A tough domestic
                  market continued; a decrease in raw material prices
                  coupled with a unique situation of lower-than-expected
                  production efficiencies and higher costs due to the learning
                  curve associated with the launch of several new products
                  and programmes caused our profitability to drop. Lower
                  efficiencies of new products on specialised machines
                  also meant lower than planned production, leading to air
                  freights to keep up with customer expectations. A global
                  slowdown in consumption led to over capacities in China
                  which resulted in low-cost goods, particularly nylon, being
                  dumped in our markets and significantly affecting our
                  margins, particularly in commodity segments. The drop in
                  local demand coupled with cheap imports also meant low-
                  capacity utilizations and caused fixed costs to be absorbed
                  by lower producing units further impacting margins.<br><br>
                  As I write this letter, we have been successful in stabilising
                  a few of our new products, achieving the desired level of
                  production efficiencies and internal rejection levels.
                  An example of this is our proprietary Soft Polyester product
which took 4 years from product development to launch to
commercialization and finally stabilisation. However, there is
still some distance to go in some of our other innovations.
I hope that we will be able to address many of these issues
in the coming fiscal year. There are several other areas that
we hope to focus on and gain from in the coming year.

                    Improving production efficiencies and bringing down the
                    rate of off-grade production in the floor covering segment
                    is going to have the highest impact on profitability going
                    forward.

                  <li>
                    Improving capacity utilisations in the commodity segments
                    by increasing the sales of value add products such as Silque
                    and mono yarns will help us cushion the impact of low
                    sales in segments such as nylon. At low/minimum capex
                    we hope to convert lines to these products and continue
                    to reduce exposure/exit of non-profitable commodity
                    segments, which are lower in the value chain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We are in the process of commissioning 3 new lines in the
                    technical yarn segment which have been installed in place
                    of and by replacing old non profitable commodity lines.

                  <li>
                    Raw material prices particularly in nylon seem to have hit
                    the bottom and stock losses of the previous few quarters
                    should now stop. As prices normalise, these will result in
                    stock gains going forward.

                  The journey thus far has been incredibly tough and
                  painstaking. This transformation journey started in 2015
                  and we have faced challenges every step of the way.
                  This includes building a capable team, building the right
                  infrastructure, building the sales network and reaching
                  the right customers, creating the products, getting
                  approvals and winning awards for supply of these products,
                  commercialising these products, building the right systems
                  for controlling and effectively managing multiple product
                  lines and finally stabilising the production of these products.
                  The lifecycle for each product is on average 5 years.
                  External shocks have not helped our cause.<br><br>
                  But it is important to remain resilient, patient and
                  continue to work undeterred and address challenges
                  one step at a time. As our product mix continues to 
                  shift from commodity products, the base of our profitability
                  will increasingly start coming from established specialised
                  products which will have a longer period of above average
                  returns compared to commodity products. As this happens,
                  our results should look vastly different as compared to what
                  they look like today.<br><br>
                  I would like to end this letter on a note of thanks to all our
                  shareholders, who have continued to support us through
                  this journey. Finally, I would also like to thank all of our
                  employees for continuing to believe in our vision and
                  working tirelessly towards it.
